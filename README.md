# MSCS631_WireShark_4
WIFI

This lab uses a provided trace file to automatically answer questions about 802.11 beacon frames and a TCP SYN segment. We use the trace file from the Wireshark Labs available at:

[http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/wireshark-traces-8.1.zip](http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/wireshark-traces-8.1.zip)

After downloading and extracting the zip file, ensure that **Wireshark_801_11.pcapng** is in the same directory as `lab4.py` (or update the path accordingly).

## Questions Addressed

1. **Beacon Frames â€“ SSIDs:**  
   Identify the two most frequent SSIDs issuing beacon frames.

2. **802.11 Channel:**  
   Determine the channel used by the APs from the beacon frames.

3. **Beacon Interval:**  
   Extract the interval between beacon frame transmissions.

4. **Source MAC Address:**  
   Obtain the source MAC address from a beacon frame.

5. **Destination MAC Address (30 Munroe St):**  
   Find the destination MAC address on the beacon frame from the "30 Munroe St" AP.

6. **MAC BSS ID (30 Munroe St):**  
   Find the BSS ID on the beacon frame from "30 Munroe St".

7. **Supported Rates:**  
   Extract both the supported and extended supported data rates from the "30 Munroe St" beacon.

8. **TCP SYN Analysis:**  
   Locate the TCP SYN frame for the HTTP request (downloading `alice.txt`) near t=24.8110, and print the three MAC address fields along with the source and destination IP addresses.

## Running the Analysis

1. Ensure that Python 3.x, Tshark, and the Pyshark library are installed.
2. Place the capture file (`Wireshark_801_11.pcapng`) in the same directory as `lab4.py` (or update the CAPTURE_FILE variable in `lab4.py` accordingly).
3. Use the provided shell script (`lab4.sh`) to create a virtual environment, install dependencies, and run the analysis.

## Command to Run

```bash
chmod +x lab4.sh
```
```bash
./lab4.sh
```
# Wireshark Lab 4: WiFi Analysis (Questions 1â€“18)

This lab analyzes a WiFi trace file to automatically answer 18 questions covering beacon frames, data transfer, and association/authentication. The analysis is performed on the trace file **Wireshark_801_11.pcapng**, which can be obtained either via live capture or downloaded automatically from:

[http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/wireshark-traces-8.1.zip](http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/wireshark-traces-8.1.zip)

   - Identify the two most frequent SSIDs issuing beacon frames.
2. **802.11 Channel:**
   - Determine the channel used by the APs.
3. **Beacon Interval:**
   - Extract the beacon interval.
4. **Source MAC:**
   - Get the source MAC address from a beacon frame.
5. **Destination MAC (30 Munroe St):**
   - Retrieve the destination MAC address from the "30 Munroe St" beacon.
6. **MAC BSS ID (30 Munroe St):**
   - Retrieve the BSS ID from the "30 Munroe St" beacon.
7. **Supported Rates:**
   - Extract both Supported Rates and Extended Supported Rates from the "30 Munroe St" beacon.
8. **TCP SYN Analysis:**
   - Analyze the TCP SYN frame for the HTTP request (alice.txt) and extract MAC and IP fields.
9. **Destination IP Interpretation:**
   - Determine if the destination IP corresponds to the destination web server.
10. **TCP SYNACK Analysis:**
    - Analyze the TCP SYNACK frame and extract MAC addresses.
11. **Association Termination:**
    - Identify the actions taken to end association.
12. **Authentication Method:**
    - Determine the authentication method used.
13. **Authentication SEQ (Host to AP):**
    - Extract the Authentication SEQ value from host to AP.
14. **AP Authentication Response:**
    - Determine if the AP accepted the authentication.
15. **Authentication SEQ (AP to Host):**
    - Extract the Authentication SEQ value from AP to host.
16. **Association Request Rates:**
    - Extract the Supported Rates from the Association Request (excluding extended rates).
17. **Association Response Status:**
    - Determine if the Association Response indicates success.
18. **Extended Supported Rate Comparison:**
    - Verify if the fastest Extended Supported Rate offered by the host matches that of the AP.

## Running the Analysis

A shell script (`lab4.sh`) is provided to create a virtual environment, install required packages (pyshark and requests), run the analysis script (`lab4.py`), and deactivate the environment.

### To Run:

1. Place **lab4.py**, **lab.md**, and **lab4.sh** in your project directory.
2. Ensure that **Wireshark_801_11.pcapng** is not present (to trigger capture or download) or update the path accordingly.
3. Open a Bash shell (Git Bash, WSL, etc.) in your project directory.
4. Make the shell script executable:
   
```bash
chmod +x lab4.sh
```

   ## Output: 

```bash
./lab4.sh
